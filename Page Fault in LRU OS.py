In operating systems that use paging for memory management, page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when the new page comes in. Whenever a new page is referred and is not present in memory, the page fault occurs and Operating System replaces one of the existing pages with a newly needed page.

Given a sequence of pages in an array pages[] of length N and memory capacity C, find the number of page faults using Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm. 

Note:- Before solving this example revising the OS LRU cache mechanism is recommended.
  
Example ->
Input: N = 9, C = 4
pages = {5, 0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 0, 5}
Output: 8
Explaination: memory allocated with 4 pages 5, 0, 1, 
3: page fault = 4
page number 2 is required, replaces LRU 5: 
page fault = 4+1 = 5
page number 4 is required, replaces LRU 0: 
page fault = 5 + 1 = 6
page number 1 is required which is already present: 
page fault = 6 + 0 = 6
page number 0 is required which replaces LRU 3: 
page fault = 6 + 1 = 7
page number 5 is required which replaces LRU 2: 
page fault = 7 + 1  = 8.

Time Complexity: O(N*C)
Auxiliary Space: O(C)

class Solution:
    def pageFaults(self, N, C, pages):
        ans = 0
        arr = []
        
        for i in pages:
            if i not in arr:
                if len(arr) < C:
                    arr.append(i)
                else:
                    arr.pop(0)
                    arr.append(i)
                ans += 1
            else:
                arr.remove(i)
                arr.append(i)
        return ans
